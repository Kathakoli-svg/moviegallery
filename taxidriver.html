<p>
Taxi Driver is famous for its iconic portrayal of urban alienation, particularly Robert De Niro's chilling performance as Travis Bickle and the famous "You talkin' to me?" scene, combined with Martin Scorsese's gritty direction, Michael Chapman's immersive cinematography, and the film's deep exploration of themes like loneliness, violence, and mental instability in 1970s New York City. Its cultural impact, critical acclaim (including a Palme d'Or win), and controversial, yet deeply resonant, look at a troubled psyche cemented its status as a cinematic masterpiece that still influences filmmakers and sparks discussion today.
