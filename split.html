Split is a psychological thriller that explores the concept of dissociative identity disorder. The film follows Kevin, a man with 23 distinct personalities, as he is kidnapped by a young girl named Casey. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Kevin's condition is far more complex than initially thought, and his multiple personalities begin to merge in unexpected ways. The movie's intense and unsettling atmosphere, combined with its exploration of mental illness and identity, makes it a compelling and disturbing watch.
